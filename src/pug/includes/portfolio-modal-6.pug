                                | This visualization shows the spread of COVID-19 and its impacts in the United States from the beginning of the pandemic (March 2020) to November 2021. As the virus continues to spread and disrupt normalcy across the globe, I wanted to visualize where COVID-19 infections have been the highest, and the overall impact on the country; I also wanted to display the deaths and vaccinations over the span of this timeframe to show COVID-19â€™s impact beyond just the cases. Through this project, I hoped to demonstrate to the reader what states and counties have been affected the most by COVID-19, in terms of number of cases, deaths, and vaccinations.
